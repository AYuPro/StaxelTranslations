staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000200=I think it's high time we started considering an expansion of my  ^c:1486b0;patisserie^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000300=Don't you agree?

staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001000=If you could whip up a nice ^c:1486b0;cheesecake^c:pop; that would be the perfect demonstration! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001100=The key with ^c:1486b0;cheesecakes^c:pop; is knowing exactly getting the cream cheese to room temperature! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001200=You'll get lumps otherwise... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001300=I can't wait to try it! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001400=Oh thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! You're a lifesaver! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001500=Thinking about baking extravagant cakes without the extra machines was starting to give me a headache! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001600=To be honest, even thinking about how much work there is to do alone is keeping me awake at night... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001700=Hey...you know what? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001800=How would you like to try being my assistant? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001900=I would love to!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001910=I'm a bit neutral on that...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002100=Oh, what a lovely aroma! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002200=Let me take a proper look at your work...

staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002500=I could hardly have baked it better myself, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002600=From today onwards, you're my new assistant!

staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003100=Today, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, we prepare for a royal wedding! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003200=The venue is on another island so we can't attend in person, but it's up to us to bake the cake. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003300=A royal wedding... That brings back memories... It will have to be the most perfect cake I've ever baked! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003400=But before all that, we need to start with the samplers! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003500=We're on a tight deadline so I can't make them all myself... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003600=How about you try your hand at the ^c:1486b0;carrot wedding cake^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003700=It's not as hard as it sounds! Start by baking three simple ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop; and bring them to me! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003800=Ah~ðŸŽ¶! Three ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop;, just like I asked!

staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004200=Baking three simple ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop; is where you want to start!

staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004400=So much work to be done! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004500=Just combine the ^c:1486b0;rods^c:pop; with the three ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004600=Wonderful! That's quite the load off my shoulders! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004700=But...um... I'm not sure how to say this... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004800=We seem to have a little bit of an emergency here... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004900=Apparently the ^c:1486b0;prince^c:pop; himself has shown up on the island to meet the patissier in charge... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005000=That, in this case, would be me... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005100=But how about we pretend it's not? What if you go in my place and entertain him? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005200=I don't really want to be recognised. Besides, I still have a lot of work to do here! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005300=If you put these on, he'll definitely think you're the one in charge! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005400=Hurry, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005500=I don't want to risk having him in my ^c:1486b0;patisserie^c:pop;! I don't want to be recognised! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005600=Oh, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005700=You managed to keep the prince sufficiently entertained then? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005800=Wait... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005900=Are those what I think they are? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006000=Did...did he just give you the ^c:1486b0;wedding rings^c:pop;...? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006100=... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006200=... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006300=Wow. I'm speechless. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006400=I knew he was a bit...dense, but this? And he's already left? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006500=Well... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006600=I suppose this isn't your fault so I shouldn't take it out on you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006700=I'll hold onto the ^c:1486b0;rings^c:pop; for now, but here's your payment for today's antics. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006800=Let's hope the actual wedding goes a bit better... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006900=Ah, did you lose your ^c:1486b0;rods^c:pop;? That's not good... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007000=Remember, they go in the cake. Not wherever you put them before... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007100=Did you lose the outfit I gave you? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007200=How on earth did you manage that? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007300=Please try to be more careful with this one...
