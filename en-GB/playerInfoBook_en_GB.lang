staxel.infoBook.animals.types=Types

staxel.infoBook.animals.overview.line1=No farm would be complete without a host of fluffy residents. Farm animals are one of the main aspects you’ll be spending your time on when going about your daily tasks so it’s important to have a good understanding of their care requirements if you want to be a responsible farmer. 

staxel.infoBook.animals.care.line1=All farm animals have the same basic needs. In order to keep your furry friends happy and healthy there are only a couple of things you need to know. 
staxel.infoBook.animals.care.line2=Firstly, animals require feeding once a day. This can be accomplished by purchasing the appropriate food from one of the vendors in town and placing it in the correct type of feeder depending on the animal.
staxel.infoBook.animals.care.line3=Secondly, your animals are quite happy just going about their business but that doesn’t mean they don’t need any love and attention. Interacting with your farm animals every day will ensure that they feel appreciated and keep them in a good mood.

staxel.infoBook.animals.produce.line1=Each type of farm animal will provide you with its own type of produce. These items can be used in crafting or sold to the vendors in town, but they can also make great gifts for some of the villagers.
staxel.infoBook.animals.produce.line2=An animal’s mood will affect whether or not it will provide any goods. Unhappy animals won’t provide you with anything at all so make sure you take good care of your farm’s inhabitants to guarantee a steady supply of produce.

staxel.infoBook.animals.relationship.line1=As your animals start getting used to their new homes, you should make an effort to pet them daily to help build their confidence. Doing this will slowly build up their mood until they are positively glowing with life. When they reach this point they’ll feel more secure in their surroundings and won’t mind too much if you forget to interact with them for a day or two. Don’t make it a habit though as your animal’s mood can change if you ignore them for too long.

staxel.infoBook.animals.weather.line1=Farm animals are hardy creatures, and while you might prefer to stay indoors on a rainy day, your animals will be just fine outside come rain or snow. You don’t need to worry about them getting sick or miserable when the weather changes. 
staxel.infoBook.animals.weather.line2=That doesn’t mean you can “forget” to feed them though. They’ll expect their breakfast and head rubs just as much as they would on a sunny day.

staxel.infoBook.animals.types.overview.line1=There are 4 different types of animals you can keep on your farm. You’ll be able to purchase them from ^Leif’s% general store or the merchant stalls in town. While they might look expensive at first, keep in mind that soon you’ll be selling the produce they supply on a daily basis, so it won’t take too long to make those ^Petals% back.
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.cow.line1=Provides ^milk% when using the ^milker%
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.cow.line2=Requires a regular ^trough% and ^trough food% for feeding
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.cow.line3=Also provides ^splat% for use in crafting
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.sheep.line1=Provides ^wool% when using the ^sheep shears%
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.sheep.line2=Requires a regular ^trough% and ^trough food% for feeding
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.pig.line1=Provides ^bacon%
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.pig.line2=Requires a ^slop trough% and ^trough food% for feeding
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.pig.line3=Also provides ^splat% for use in crafting
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.chicken.line1=Provides ^eggs%
staxel.infoBook.animals.types.chicken.line2=Requires a ^chicken feeding area% and ^chicken food% for feeding

//Beekeeping
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.title=Beekeeping
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.housing=Housing
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.bees=Bees
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.honey=Honey

staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.overview.line1=Keeping bees might seem a little daunting to some, but when you really get to know them you’ll discover there isn’t much to be afraid of. Bees are passive creatures if you treat them with kindness, so getting the basics down when it comes to their care is the best place to start for any budding apiarist.

staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.housing.line1=The first thing you’ll need before you can start keeping bees is a place for them to call home. ^Apiaries% can be bought from either the general store or the building store in town, although it’s probably best to start off with just one to see how you get on.
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.housing.line2=Place your ^apiary% down in a convenient location on the farm, but try not to put it where it might get in the way in the future. You can always move your ^apiary% by using your hammer to pick it up, but doing so will cause all the bees to fly off in search of a new residence.

staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.bees.line1=Once you’ve picked a spot and placed down your ^apiary% you’ll need to find yourself a ^queen bee% to begin the process of making honey. Queen bees can be found all year round and they like to spend their time hovering above flowers, so grab your bug net and let the search begin!
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.bees.line2=When you’ve found your queen bee simply place her inside the hive and let her familiarise herself with her new surroundings. The queen will start rallying worker bees straight away, but you can speed up the process if you managed to catch some of your own while out bug hunting. Place them into the hive and it will add them to the required total. A hive needs 10 bees as well as a queen to start producing honey.

staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.honey.line1=All that’s left to do now is sit back and wait for the bees to complete their work. It takes 3 days for bees to produce a batch of honey, and as long as you leave them to it they’ll start the process again every time you collect it. This can be done by getting yourself an ^empty jar% and a ^smoker%, both of which can be found in ^Leif’s% general store.
staxel.infoBook.beekeeping.honey.line2=To collect your honey you need to calm the bees down by using the smoker on the hive. They won’t let you get near it otherwise. Once the bees are relaxed equip the empty jar and interact with the hive, and there you have it. Your very first batch of honey is ready to be sold, gifted to villagers or used as an ingredient for a cooking recipe. Well done!

//Bug Catching
staxel.infoBook.bugcatching.title=Bug Catching

staxel.infoBook.bugcatching.overview.line1=The island is brimming with all sorts of interesting critters for the budding bug aficionado to discover, but before you get started you’ll need to get yourself a ^bug net%. You can pick one of these up from Leif’s store in town.
staxel.infoBook.bugcatching.overview.line2=Bugs can be found just about anywhere on the island, although they each have their own preferred environment. Some bugs like the ^rhino beetle% will spend their time up in the trees, while others like ^dragonflies% prefer to hang out where there’s water nearby. 
staxel.infoBook.bugcatching.overview.line3=^Seasons% and changing ^weather% conditions will play a big part in when you’ll be able to find some specific bugs too. If you’re looking for a particular bug for your collection and you’re struggling to find it, you may need to wait until the conditions are right before it’ll appear.
staxel.infoBook.bugcatching.overview.line4=Bugs can be sold to the vendors in town for a quick way to make some ^Petals%, and some bugs can even be used in crafting recipes. Once you’ve got a ^Museum% in the village you can donate your bugs to the collection and potentially net yourself a reward or two!

//Building
staxel.infoBook.building.title=Building
staxel.infoBook.building.totems=Totems
staxel.infoBook.building.tiles=Tiles
staxel.infoBook.building.tools=Tools

staxel.infoBook.building.overview.line1=When you’re not too busy down on the farm or out exploring the island, you might find the time to take on a building project. It could be an overdue extension to your house, a little cabin in the forest for those gathering trips you make every so often, or one of the villagers might’ve requested your help with a building project of their own. Whatever it is, there are certain things you should know that’ll help you along your way.

staxel.infoBook.building.totems.line1=Town buildings and structures all make use of their own dedicated ^totem%. These objects are generally ^signposts% or ^post boxes% and they serve to let you if a structure’s base requirements have been met. Interacting with a totem will display a list of the necessary items needed to register the building “complete”. Keep in mind you may have to ^disable area protection% in the totem display before you’ll be able to make any alterations to a structure. Buildings can extend outside of their totem area too as long as the essential items are kept within it. There’s no need to feel limited, you can make any building as big as you like.
staxel.infoBook.building.totems.line2=Some totems may have second or third ^tiers%, these are the conditions that will need to be met to expand the building if a villager needs more room. Villagers will let you know if they need their houses or shops expanded so there’s no need to worry about taking on the task before you’re asked to.
staxel.infoBook.building.totems.line3=If a villager’s home has been ^damaged% and the totem requirements are no longer complete, they will start making preparations to leave the town via the ^airship%. If this happens, don’t panic! Simply completing the totem requirements again will allow them to come back. In the same way, if a store or festival area’s totem requirements are no longer met, they’ll stop functioning and you’ll miss out on events and items until you’ve repaired the damage. Just be careful when running around town with your hammer and there’ll be nothing to worry about.

staxel.infoBook.building.tiles.line1=Building tiles and materials can be purchased in town from ^Aliza’s% building store or from the catalogue, but you can craft a lot of the items you need instead to save yourself a few ^Petals%. You can see your known crafting ^recipes% by selecting the crafting tab above your inventory and browsing recipes according to their material type using the subcategories on the left-hand side.
staxel.infoBook.building.tiles.line2=^Totem% requirements don’t generally ask for a specific tile colour or design so you can be as creative as you like when you’re planning out your project.

staxel.infoBook.building.tools.line1=Certain tools lend themselves better to construction work than others. After prepping the area and digging a foundation you’ll probably be able to make do with nothing but a ^hammer%. There is one tool however which will make the planning phase a whole lot easier, ^the measuring tape%.
staxel.infoBook.building.tools.line2=With a measuring tape equipped you can measure the distance between two points by selecting a tile to start from and then selecting a second point to measure to. Doing this will display a notification box letting you know the distance between the two tiles. This could potentially save you a lot of headaches when used correctly as nobody wants to get to the end of their building project only to discover the roof doesn’t meet up in the middle.
staxel.infoBook.building.tools.line3=^Creative mode% provides even more tools to work with when undertaking building projects. These advanced tools can be quite difficult to get the hang of so make sure you practice away from the village before adding them to your tool belt.
staxel.infoBook.building.tools.line4=You can change the settings on these tools by looking at a tile and selecting it using the secondary interact button.

//Crafting
staxel.infoBook.crafting.title=Crafting
staxel.infoBook.crafting.cooking=Cooking

staxel.infoBook.crafting.overview.line1=With a world so full of materials to discover it’d be a waste if you didn’t use them to make something useful. Crafting is a skill that’ll prove invaluable during your time on the island, and the townsfolk will certainly appreciate having a capable crafter around to turn to when they need a hand getting something done. 
staxel.infoBook.crafting.overview.line2=There are two main types of crafting. Firstly, as the local farmer, it only makes sense that you learn how to ^cook% considering you have your own personal supply of ingredients to work with. 
staxel.infoBook.crafting.overview.line3=Secondly, crafting ^useful items% like building tiles or furniture, which will really come in handy when the villagers start asking you for help or someone new wants to move into town.

staxel.infoBook.crafting.cooking.line1=To get started with cooking you’ll need to learn a few ^recipes% first. ^Leif% sells cooking recipes in the general store so make sure to pay him a visit when you can. ^Emilia% has a strong interest in cooking as well, and she might even give you a few tips as you get to know her better.
staxel.infoBook.crafting.cooking.line2=Your known ^recipes% can be found under the cooking tab at the top of your inventory. Here you can also switch between subcategories on the left-hand side. Scroll through the recipe list in the main window and once you’ve chosen the one you want to try you can pin it by selecting the circle icon next to the recipe name. This will cause a recipe shortlist to appear which you can follow along with to help you complete the cooking process.
staxel.infoBook.crafting.cooking.line3=Cooking food requires the use of ^cooking stations%, Leif sells these in his shop too. Each recipe step will need one of these stations to complete it:
staxel.infoBook.crafting.cooking.line4=Simply place the ingredients down on the relevant station and interact with it to begin the process for that step. Crafting stations have a set number of docks for ingredients. You can place up to 4 ingredients on a crafting station, but there are ^special crafting stations% you might come across later on that’ll let you use more.
staxel.infoBook.crafting.cooking.line5=Continue working your way through the recipe steps and when you’re done you’ll have a delicious treat to reward you for your hard work! (Or one you could just sell for a tidy profit). Many of the villagers have a favourite food too, so you could always give out your homemade goods as presents to your neighbours.

staxel.infoBook.crafting.crafting.line1=^Aliza% is the girl to go to for all things related to crafting useful items. Her ^building store% in town sells everything you need such as recipes, crafting ingredients and crafting stations. The only things you’ll need to supply are the raw materials like stone, wood, or coloured petals.
staxel.infoBook.crafting.crafting.line2=Crafting useful items will require the use of these stations:
staxel.infoBook.crafting.crafting.line3=Once again, your known ^recipes% can be found under the crafting tab at the top of the inventory window. Here you’ll see subcategories on the left-hand side for ^wood%, ^stone%, and ^magic%. Selecting one of these tabs will bring up the list of recipes related to that material. Same as before, you can pin the recipe for easy access by selecting the circle icon next to the recipe for the item you want to craft.
staxel.infoBook.crafting.crafting.line4=Make your way through the recipe steps for the item you’ve chosen to craft and by the time you’re finished you’ll have a brand new useful item to make use of in the various projects you’ve got going on. Well done!

//Crops
staxel.infoBook.crops.title=Crops
staxel.infoBook.crops.seasonal=Seasonal Varieties
staxel.infoBook.crops.fruit=Fruit Trees and Berry Bushes
staxel.infoBook.crops.planting=Planting
staxel.infoBook.crops.tending=Tending
staxel.infoBook.crops.harvesting=Harvesting
staxel.infoBook.crops.selling=Selling

staxel.infoBook.crops.overview.line1=From the smallest blueberry to the largest watermelon, each crop requires a dedicated farmer’s love and care to raise them from seedling to maturity. Tending to your crops will require quite a bit of hard work but it’ll all be worth it when you’re finally able to harvest those delicious (and valuable) fruits and vegetables. 
staxel.infoBook.crops.overview.line2=You can purchase most seeds in town from the village shop or the merchants, but there are also special seeds which you’ll come across now and then while exploring the island or making friends with the villagers.

staxel.infoBook.crops.seasonal.line1=Most crops have a growth period which falls into a specific season or two, with a few exceptions. These seasonal crops are sold in ^red% seed packets and you can see which seasons they’re compatible with by reading the item description in your inventory.
staxel.infoBook.crops.seasonal.line2=The vendors won’t sell seeds which are out of season so you don’t need to worry about purchasing the wrong type of seed, but crops will wither and die if they’re not completely grown by the time a new season comes around, so it’s a good idea to pay attention to the calendar and plan out your planting beforehand.

staxel.infoBook.crops.fruit.line1=These crops are different from seasonal crops in that once you’ve planted them, they’ll keep growing regardless of the season. Keep in mind though that they’ll only start producing their fruits once the right season comes along. Fruit trees and berry bushes are sold in ^purple% seed packets and although they’re a bit more expensive than their seasonal cousins, they will carry on producing fruit after each harvest during their compatible season.

staxel.infoBook.crops.planting.line1=Once you’ve picked out your seeds and are ready to start planting you’ll need to prepare an area for them. Seeds can only be planted on ^tilled dirt% tiles, for that you’ll need to equip your ^hoe% and start clearing an area of grass to allow your seeds the room they need to flourish.
staxel.infoBook.crops.planting.line2=Having prepped the area you can now equip your seeds and start sowing them onto the ground. Most crops will only take up 1 tile worth of space per seed packet, but fruit trees and some seasonal crops such as pumpkins and watermelons require a larger area to grow. You can find out if a specific crop needs more room by checking the seed packet’s item description in your inventory.
staxel.infoBook.crops.planting.line3=With that out of the way you can move onto the next step - watering. Seeds won’t start growing until they’ve been watered, so equip your ^watering can% and make sure to give each patch of seeds a drink to get them started. ^Trees% and ^bushes% only need to be watered ^once% to start their growth process, after that they’ll figure it out for themselves so you can sit back, relax and wait for them to start producing fruit.

staxel.infoBook.crops.tending.line1=For most crops, the work doesn’t stop at planting. You’ll need to tend to your crops to ensure they keep growing healthily. This means you’ll be doing a lot of watering, and while it might seem like a daunting task, once you develop a good technique with your watering can you’ll able to get through it in no time at all.
staxel.infoBook.crops.tending.line2=Besides trees and bushes, crops will need watering once per day until they’re fully grown. You can see how many days a specific crop will take to grow by looking at the seed packet’s item description. This process can be sped up by using ^fertiliser% on the crop to make it grow quicker, or by using ^Magic Water% to make it grow instantly.
staxel.infoBook.crops.tending.line3=If you forget to water your crops they will start to wilt, forgetting to water them again will cause them to die. If you’ve got some fertiliser handy though, giving them a splash of that when they’re wilted will help to revive them quicker.
staxel.infoBook.crops.tending.line4=Lastly, you don’t need to worry about watering your plants on rainy or snowy days, so it’s a good idea to use this time to catch up on other tasks, like taking a day off to unwind.

staxel.infoBook.crops.harvesting.line1=Now that your crops are fully grown it’s time to enjoy the fruits of your labour (literally)! Interact with a fully grown plant to harvest the produce (you can also use your ^scythe% to harvest a bit quicker). Some plants will keep producing crops every few days for the rest of the season, like the cucumber, for example. Be careful when using your ^scythe% around these plants as you could end up chopping them down by mistake and losing out on potential profit.

staxel.infoBook.crops.selling.line1=Crops can be sold by placing them on a merchant’s ^sell box% in town and then interacting with it, or by dropping them into an empty slot on your ^shipping station% where they’ll sell overnight. One thing to be aware of when selling your produce is that the price of the crop will start dropping if you sell too much of the same fruit or vegetable. The best way to avoid this is to diversify a little in your crop choices when you’re planning out your planting at the start of the season.

//Events
staxel.infoBook.events.title=Events
staxel.infoBook.events.fey=Fey Masquerade
staxel.infoBook.events.pumpkin=Pumpking Festival
staxel.infoBook.events.snow=Snowdust Faire

staxel.infoBook.events.overview.line1=Throughout the year the townsfolk will hold special events which last for a few days. These days will be marked in ^blue% on the calendar during the night transition.
staxel.infoBook.events.overview.line2=Be sure to visit the ^Festival Square% on these dates to take part in the events and meet some colourful new characters. You might even win a prize or two!

staxel.infoBook.events.fey.line1=Event date: Spring 16 - Spring 21
staxel.infoBook.events.fey.line2=The ^Fey Queen% is visiting from the fairy realm to host the annual Fey Masquerade festival, but some naughty fey have been up to no good. Will you help her catch the ^mischievous fey% and restore the misplaced items in the Fey Manor so that the festival can proceed?

staxel.infoBook.events.pumpkin.line1=Event date: Autumn 9 - Autumn 14
staxel.infoBook.events.pumpkin.line2=The Pumpking’s emissaries have descended upon the village once more. It’s time for the ^Pumpking’s Feast!% Lend a helping hand with the preparations in order to take part in some spooky festivities.

staxel.infoBook.events.snow.line1=Event date: Winter 5 - Winter 10
staxel.infoBook.events.snow.line2=The cold silence of Winter is a natural time for self-reflection. Visit ^Ami% at the shrine during the ^Snowdust Faire% to make a wish for the future, or at the very least to win yourself some festival-themed prizes!

//Fishing
//Titles
staxel.infoBook.fishing.title=Fishing

staxel.infoBook.fishing.overview.line1=There’s nothing quite as relaxing as finding a quiet spot on the waterside and settling in to do a bit of fishing. It’s not just a way to kill time though, fish can be quite valuable when sold to the vendors in town. If you want to try your hand at fishing there’s nobody who knows more about it than ^Riah%, so make sure to have a chat with her when you’re ready to get started.
staxel.infoBook.fishing.overview.line2=Once you’ve got your first ^fishing rod%, all you need to do is find a suitable spot on the water’s edge and equip it from your inventory. Look around for a lucky looking water tile, cast your line and wait for a bite.
staxel.infoBook.fishing.overview.line3=When you’ve got a fish on the line, you’ll see a tension bar show up. Keep reeling in the fish until the bar fills up. You’ll need to ease off a bit when the tension bar turns red or your line will snap!
staxel.infoBook.fishing.overview.line4=Different types of fish can be caught in different types of water. Lakes and ponds will let you catch ^freshwater fish%, while fishing in the sea will provide ^tropical fish%. There are other types of water to be found though so always keep your fishing rod on you and keep an eye out for potential new fishing spots.
staxel.infoBook.fishing.overview.line5=As mentioned before, fish can be sold to vendors for an easy way to make some ^Petals%, but there are other uses for them too. Once you’ve got a ^Museum% in town you can donate fish to the collection and potentially earn yourself some rewards!

//Gathering
staxel.infoBook.gathering.title=Gathering
staxel.infoBook.gathering.resources=Resources
staxel.infoBook.gathering.collectables=Collectables
staxel.infoBook.gathering.ingredients=Ingredients
staxel.infoBook.gathering.sellables=Sellables

staxel.infoBook.gathering.overview.line1=There are many things to be found when out and about on the island. A lot of these items have very special uses so make sure you clear some space in your inventory before you go out exploring.

staxel.infoBook.gathering.resources.line1=When crafting blocks for building projects, you’re going to need a lot of raw materials. Luckily for you the island is full of them! You can collect ^wood%, ^stone%, and other resources by equipping the appropriate tool and getting to work. There is an endless amount of ^stone% to be mined if you just dig deep enough, trees however won’t regrow by themselves so be sure to plant a few ^saplings% as you go about your chopping. 

staxel.infoBook.gathering.collectables.line1=There are certain items dotted around the island that you won’t find stocked in a shop. Always keep an eye out for something interesting when you’re out exploring, some of these items can be traded for rewards!

staxel.infoBook.gathering.ingredients.line1=Many of the crafting and cooking ^recipes% call for ingredients that you’ll need to gather up yourself. A lot of these ingredients can only be found in certain areas or in specific seasons so keeping them tucked away somewhere for when you need them is always a good idea. Mushrooms for instance only grow during rainy periods, and ^star jelly% will only show up lodged in trees.
staxel.infoBook.gathering.ingredients.line2=Other items like coloured petals can be collected just about anywhere and are always available. You’ll start to remember where and when you’ll be able to find what you’re looking for in time, the best thing to do until then is go out exploring!

staxel.infoBook.gathering.sellables.line1=Some gatherables will fetch a decent price when sold to a vendor in town. ^Shells% can be found scattered on the beach, while ^bugs% and ^wild fruit% are more likely to be found in the forests and meadows. Collecting these early on gives you a nice and easy way to make some ^Petals% when you’re just starting out.
