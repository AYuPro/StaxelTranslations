staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000100=Hey there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000200=I've been doing a bit of thinking recently... 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000300=Sure it's fun to just skate around and catch bugs, but I think I can do something more... 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000400=Once upon a time, things were quite different for me, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000500=I didn't always have quite this much freedom of expression! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000600=So I'd like to pass that opportunity on to others too! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000700=But to do that I'm going to need a little help from you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000800=What I'd like you to do is actually pretty easy! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000900=I want you to make me a ^c:d03e37;small wagon^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001000=You know, a bit like the ones the Murmurs come by in to trade! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001100=Trouble is... I'm not even sure where to begin with that... 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001200=Perhaps you could go talk to a few of them and see if they're willing to give you some advice? 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001300=Oh, you managed to convince them to give up a ^c:d03e37;wagon blueprint^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001400=That's great! Thanks ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001500=I'll be waiting right here to see it finished! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001600=Yes! This is exactly what I was talking about, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001700=Great job! Soon I'll be able to show people the meaning of individual freedom! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001800=For now, let's just see how this goes before we think about expanding any further! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001900=Thanks lots for all your help, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002000=Feel free to take a look around when I have my wares out! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002100=Did you manage to find anything out from the Murmurs? 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002200=I really think it would help to get some idea how their ^c:d03e37;wagons^c:pop; are built! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002300=Ohh! It's so much nicer than I imagined! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002400=You've done a great job, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002500=Now I just need you to set it up somewhere for me! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002600=Just place my ^c:d03e37;store sign^c:pop; down somewhere with the ^c:d03e37;wagon^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002700=I'll be waiting right here to see it finished! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002800=How about it, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002900=Just place my ^c:d03e37;store sign^c:pop; down somewhere with the ^c:d03e37;wagon^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003000=That's all we have left to do!
