staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000100=Hey there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000200=How's it going down at the farm? Pretty good I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000300=You moving in there has been a little bit of a problem for me after all... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000400=Oh, not that I mean to accuse you or anything...I was technically just squatting after all. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000500=But it does mean I don't really have anywhere to live right now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000600=The ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop; is okay, but it does get a bit crowded with ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; around at night. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000700=And I get the feeling ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; doesn't likely leaving me unattended in his establishment... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000800=So what do you say? Feeling up to building me a house? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10000900=This ^c:d03e37;mailbox^c:pop; will designate the house as being mine once it's complete! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001000=I hope I can count on you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001100=Still working on my house I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001200=Alternatively I can just move back in at your place? No? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001300=Nice, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Very nice! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001400=Now I won't have to sleep in the ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop; with one eye open any more! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001500=This is just a little reward to congratulate you on a job well done. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001600=Thanks for all your help! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001700=Hey, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, how's the farm? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001800=I'm still trying to get properly settled in to my new home. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10001900=It's just...I think I'm too used to sleeping with all the farm memorabilia around... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002000=It's surprisingly hard to fall asleep without them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002100=Maybe you could help me by tracking down some old bits and pieces around the island? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002200=Just a few things that are very collectable, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002300=I'd settle for a ^c:d03e37;star jelly^c:pop;, a ^c:d03e37;fossilised slime^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;RARE SEASHELL^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002400=Do you think you can manage that? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002500=Nice! This is a really good start! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002600=I hope you're all warmed up now because the next ones are going to be a bit tougher! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002700=A long time ago, there was an ^c:d03e37;old tractor^c:pop; that got stuck in a ditch somewhere around here. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002800=I think if you went mining a few ^c:d03e37;fossil rocks^c:pop; you might be able to come across some parts of it. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10002900=I think a ^c:d03e37;star jelly^c:pop;, a ^c:d03e37;fossilised slime^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;RARE SEASHELL^c:pop; would help me feel a bit more at home. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003000=Think you can get all of those? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003100=Oooh, yes! This is a wonderful piece of memorabilia! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003200=While you were out digging that up, I remembered something else. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003300=There were some ^c:d03e37;old tools^c:pop; the previous owner used to use a lot. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003400=I think he lost some of them in one of the ^c:1486b0;lakes^c:pop;. Maybe you could fish them up? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003500=Any luck find parts of that ^c:d03e37;old tractor^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003600=I imagine you might be able to dig them up by mining a few ^c:d03e37;fossil rocks^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003700=Yes, these are the ones I remember! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003800=A bit rusty maybe, but they're definitely very collectable! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10003900=Now, there's just one last thing... It might be the most important thing too... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004000=There's a limited-time online auction running for some really rare pieces of memorabilia... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004100=Items that belonged to legendary farmers who changed the world! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004200=The trouble is...they're a bit expensive... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004300=Do you think you could put together ^c:d03e37;{0-currency}10,000,000^c:pop; over the next two days? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004400=I understand if you can't, but still... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004500=Did you manage to fish up any of the ^c:d03e37;old tools^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004600=I know they fell into one of the ^c:1486b0;lakes^c:pop; around here. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004700=There's still time left, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004800=You can still gather the money! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10004900=Well...it looks like we couldn't raise the money in time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005000=But...that's okay I suppose. I heard ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; was the one who actually won it... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005100=So perhaps we could still try reasoning with him? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005200=He wouldn't say anything about it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005300=Oh well... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005400=I suppose I'll keep looking for other things... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005500=Thanks for helping me out so far though! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005600=Hi, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005700=I think ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; said he wanted to see you whenever you're free... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005800=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; told me to send you over if you came on by. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10005900=Hmm? ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? My birthday? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006000=Oh...I suppose that is coming up, isn't it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006100=You want to give everything to me now? Well I'm not about to say no! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006200=Oh! I've been searching for a copy of this book for years! Where did you find it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006300=Oh oh! And is this that item ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; won on auction? He bought it for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006400=You baked the ^c:d03e37;cake^c:pop;, you say? I'm sure it will be delicious! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006500=Although...it looks like you didn't quite know what name to put on the cake... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006600=Thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! People don't usually want to celebrate my birthday... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006700=Could you pass on my thanks to ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; as well? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006800=I think I want to keep admiring my presents... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10006900=Hi, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007000=I've been keeping an eye on your progress and it looks like you've really settled in. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007100=This is a wonderful island, right? Do you think you're ready for the ultimate test? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007200=At some point, everyone has to go through this to prove just how much they know about the island! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007300=Before you arrived, I hid ^c:d03e37;13 bobbleheads^c:pop; around the village! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007400=If you can find them all and show them to me, I'll acknowledge that you know the village like the back of your hand. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007500=It doesn't matter what order you bring them in, just head out and find them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007600=Oh, you found another ^c:d03e37;bobblehead^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007700=Let me see! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007800=Ahh, I remember this one... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10007900=He talked a lot about landscape and terrain, especially beaches. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008000=Maybe he was a painter? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008100=I'd love to get her to design me a furniture set someday! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008200=Custom made is always the best! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008300=If memory serves, he makes lots of really cool music! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008400=Maybe we can get him to come play a live concert or something? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008500=He's an artist! I think everyone in the village likes wearing his branded clothes. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008600=Before I met this one, I was a little less sarcastic... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008700=I wonder what that means? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008800=He's the one who makes everything around here work. Literally everything. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10008900=He works a lot with sounds. They really make games come alive! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009000=I see him running around everywhere! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009100=I think he puts out newsletters and things like that a lot too. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009200=He's the architect who built all the houses in the village! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009300=Nothing has fallen down yet! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009400=He claims to exist only when you're not looking... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009500=But I'm absolutely sure I've seen him around a few times... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009600=I heard he invented the ^c:d03e37;sprinkler^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009700=We could definitely use more of those around here! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009800=He does a lot of work in marketing! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10009900=Maybe he could help getting more visitors interested in our festivals? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010000=Hmm... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010100=Something about this ^c:d03e37;bobblehead^c:pop; seems missing... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010200=So I think that just leaves ^c:d03e37;{0-remainingBobbleheads} bobbleheads^c:pop; to go! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010300=Oh, I think that's all of them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010400=Wow. I didn't think you'd actually manage to find them all! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010500=Even I forgot where I put most of them... 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010600=I suppose that means you're the one who knows this village the best! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010700=You've definitely come a long way since you first got here. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010800=I still remember the day you arrived...showing you the ropes. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10010900=Who knew you'd surpass me this quickly? 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10011000=I still remember the day you arrived...when you told me you were already a licensed farmer. 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10011100=It was exciting to have another expert around! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10011200=If you're ever lonely on that farm, just know that I'd still love to live there! 
staxel.village.dialogue.FarmFanPrimary.line:10011300=You can ask me any time!
