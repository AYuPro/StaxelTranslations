staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000100=Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I was wondering if you might be around. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000200=Are you the one who's been leaving rubbish all over the village? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000300=Um...no. Not me.
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000400=Definitely not!
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000500=I...might have?
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000600=Well frankly, I'm keeping an eye on you regardless... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000700=And someone has to clean everything up. Perhaps this would be a good opportunity to show some goodwill? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000800=I see you currently don't have a ^c:d03e37;broom^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10000900=That's definitely something we'll need to rectify. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001000=You can buy one from the ^c:1486b0;local store^c:pop;. I suggest you do so at your earliest convenience. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001100=Recently I've been looking for someone who shares my mindset. Someone who can sweep as well as I can. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001200=How about you go out there and clean up this village? It's as much your problem as it is mine! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001300=I've marked the rubbish on your map. Come back when you've cleaned it all up. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001400=Still working diligently? Not quite ready to throw down the broom, I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001500=Do let me know once the streets are clean again. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001600=A fair first try at cleaning, though I'm not sure how you missed the enormous mound of rubbish in the middle of the village... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001700=Perhaps you could finish off the job and clean the rest of that up? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001800=Something about that mound seems...off somehow. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10001900=I feel as though I've seen something that looks similar... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002000=Please do clean it up soon. It's unsettling. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002100=Aha. To be honest, I'm surprised you managed to clean up that thoroughly. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002200=This will do. For now at least. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002300=Consider this a sign that I'm moderately pleased with your work. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002400=Do stay in touch. We might actually get along. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002500=Empty Text 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002600=It keeps happening, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002700=Three times now, I've swept the streets until they practically shone. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002800=But again, rubbish strewn everywhere. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10002900=Do you still have your broom? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003000=Perhaps you could make up for the mud you track everywhere by cleaning this mess. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003100=I need to rest my back. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003200=Ah, a fair job, though if not for my back I would have done it more efficiently. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003300=You saw the state of my home... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003400=I'm begging to think someone is targeting me specifically... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003500=This may not be our society's usual disregard for the environment... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003600=Something far more nefarious is at work! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003700=I need you to deliver this note to ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop;. He needs to know what is becoming of his village. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003800=It would never have happened under my watch... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10003900=Oof. It hurts every time I sweep. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004000=Yet I must still sweep. Who else will keep these streets clean? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004100=You still haven't tidied up the rubbish I asked you to... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004200=What are you waiting for? Take that note to ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004300=Who knows what the culprit could be vandalising as we speak? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004400=Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I was beginning to think you weren't coming back. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004500=Not that it would matter, of course. I just want to confirm that my message was delivered. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004600=Now, if you wouldn't mind... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004700=I've been preparing a last line of defence in case the vandal returns. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004800=These all come from my personal stores. Go forth and recruit me an army. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10004900=I would have you give one to ^c:1486b0;Aliza^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop;, and ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005000=Oh, ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; and ^c:1486b0;Riah^c:pop; too. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005100=give those brooms to ^c:1486b0;Aliza^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop;, and ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005200=Oh, ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; and ^c:1486b0;Riah^c:pop; too. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005300=Ah, good work. Could've been a bit snappier, but then you do seem a little slow. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005400=Perhaps this will deter the vandal. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005500=If not...we may have to do something a little more extreme... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005600=For your troubles, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. You did well. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005700=-ish. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005800=Shh! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10005900=This is very serious business. Keep your voice low. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006000=I no longer believe ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop; is doing all he can to apprehend this vandal... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006100=Perhaps...no. It's too much to suggest that he might be the vandal himself... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006200=Regardless, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, I think it's high time I renewed my own political campaign... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006300=But we can't do this alone! ^c:1486b0;Aliza^c:pop; knows how to build excellent ^c:d03e37;signboards^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006400=I suggest you first go talk to her about that. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006500=What are you waiting for, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006600=I can hardly go myself. The others would start to suspect! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006700=Ah, decent work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I trust she didn't suspect? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006800=Now, I think a decent first batch would be about ten, wouldn't you say? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10006900=If you could make them and put them up around the village, I'll let you off cleaning for the day. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007000=Still not quite enough of them around the village I'd say... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007100=Perhaps you could put up a few more? Ten total should do the trick. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007200=I saw my own face as I was sweeping one of the nearby pathways! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007300=There certainly seems to be a good few of those ^c:d03e37;signboards^c:pop; around. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007400=I might even be convinced to say you did good work today, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007500=Now, there's one last thing that needs to be taken care of. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007600=If you could deliver this ^c:d03e37;letter of challenge^c:pop; to ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Caretaker.line:10007700=That should officially start the process. Then we just wait a few days and see what happens.
