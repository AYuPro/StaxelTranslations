staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000100=Oh, hello ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000200=How is everything these days? I heard you were working with ^c:1486b0;Aliza^c:pop; on some interesting things? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000300=Seems you were the one who managed to secure some of the resources I used for my latest experiment too! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000400=Hmm, is that an ^c:d03e37;airship blueprint^c:pop; you have there? How about I take a look? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000500=No, no. This isn't going to work like that... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000600=You can't just remove parts and expect it to go faster. That would just compromise stability! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000700=Here, this might be a better path to follow, but there are still some fundamental problems... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000800=You can't just break the laws of physics! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000900=Airships don't run on magic you know! It doesn't exist! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001000=But...say it did exist...it would probably be the key to circumventing the flaws... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001100=Hello there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001200=I've been in this village for quite some time now but I've yet to see many scientific advancements. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001300=I suspect this is largely due to the inadequate facilities available for research and development. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001400=After much careful consideration, I have decided to enlist your aid in rectifying the situation. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001500=You will help me, won't you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001600=Of course!
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001700=Maybe some other time.
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001800=Ah. I hadn't considered this outcome. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001900=I'll have to think on it some more... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002000=Great! I wouldn't have expected any less from you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002100=So, first steps, first steps... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002200=Right! I suppose I'll need to get a permit for the establishment of a ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002300=Wouldn't want to be conducting dangerous experiments without permission to do so! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002400=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; would be absolutely furious! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002500=So how about you go see ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; and convince him to let us turn my home into a ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002600=You got the ^c:d03e37;permit^c:pop; then? Excellent! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002700=I've already begun documenting all the ^c:1486b0;machines^c:pop; I'm going to need for my experiments. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002800=These should tell you everything you need to know to get the place built! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10002900=I've thought hard about it, and I think you should expand ^c:1486b0;my home^c:pop; to accommodate them. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003000=So basically, get them made and install them in ^c:1486b0;my home^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003100=Any luck getting that ^c:d03e37;permit^c:pop; from ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003200=I don't really want to start construction without his permission... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003300=But I will if I have to! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003400=I trust the blueprints I supplied were detailed enough? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003500=I hope I'm not going to be in the way too much while you perform the renovations! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003600=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! It's a ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003700=Ahh...that satisfying thrum of electrical motion...how have I slept without it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003800=I'll be sure to let you know how my experiments proceed! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10003900=I hope that I'll be able to come up with some satisfactory results! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004000=Until then, good luck with the farm! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004100=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! It's a disaster! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004200=I was experimenting with my microwave when something terrible happened... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004300=I won't go into details on the experiment itself. Suffice to say it would have changed the world had it succeeded... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004400=But it didn't. It exploded instead. And now ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; is off cowering in a corner... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004500=I want to make him ^c:d03e37;a gift^c:pop; as an apology... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004600=Do you think I could trouble you to make some ^c:d03e37;machine parts^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004700=One ^c:d03e37;Machine Screen^c:pop;, two ^c:d03e37;Machine Cells^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;Machine Sapper^c:pop; should do it. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004800=That was quicker than I expected, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10004900=How do you manage to work so fast? Some of those parts can take me weeks to make myself! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005000=I'll get to work on fixing everything up. In the meantime, feel free to go about your daily business. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005100=There isn't much more you can do here right now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005200=I really want to apologise properly to ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005300=Could you make me one ^c:d03e37;Machine Screen^c:pop;, two ^c:d03e37;Machine Cells^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;Machine Sapper^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005400=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! It's a miracle! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005500=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; seems to have forgiven us already! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005600=I also managed to finish preparing ^c:1486b0;Leif's^c:pop; gift. Maybe you could deliver it for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005700=Quickly, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005800=I don't want to leave ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; cowering in his store too long... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10005900=It all went well I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10006000=How much was he cowering? Not at all? Well... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10006100=I hope that means he's forgiven us at least... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10006200=I heard you went out of your way to insure the town so I can perform even bigger experiments! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10006300=I hope you'll accept these as a payment of sorts... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10006400=Look forward to my next experiment!
