staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000100=Oh, hello ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000200=How is everything these days? I heard you were working with ^c:1486b0;Aliza^c:pop; on some interesting things? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000300=Seems you were the one who managed to secure some of the resources I used for my latest experiment too! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10000400=Hmm, is that an ^c:d03e37;airship blueprint^c:pop; you have there? How about I take a look?

staxel.village.dialogue.ScientistPrimary.line:10001000=But...say it did exist...it would probably be the key to circumventing the flaws...
