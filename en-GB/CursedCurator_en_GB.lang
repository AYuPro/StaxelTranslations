staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000200=... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000300=Eh? What? Are these arms? Legs? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000350=Am I me again? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000400=Astounding! Fantastic! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000500=What did you do? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000600=Ahh. You cannot imagine how wonderful it is to have arms and legs again! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000700=There is nothing quite comparable to spending a few decades as an insect... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000800=Ah, but I seem to be getting ahead of myself. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000900=I am ^c:1486b0;{0-name}^c:pop;, once curator of a magnificent museum in a farawy land. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000950=How did I come to be an insect? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001000=Hmm... I do believe we should gloss over that for now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001100=Perhaps if you pay me a visit ^c:1486b0;on the morrow^c:pop;, we might discuss a few details? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001200=I must first reaccustom myself to this body and finally get some rest. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001300=You have no idea how long those blasted spiders were chasing me! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001500=Please, allow me a day to rest before we begin our discussions. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001600=Come back ^c:1486b0;on the morrow^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001700=Ah, what a fine day to be humanoid again! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001800=I cannot believe how comfortable the tavern floor was last night! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001900=So. To business! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002000=I took the liberty of examining your 'village' in the early morning hours. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002100=As I suspected, and much to my horror I might add, you lack a ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002200=Perhaps you are not aware, but ^c:1486b0;museums^c:pop; are of paramount importance in these settings. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002300=Where else will you store and display all the valuables you uncover? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002400=As such, I must impose upon you to construct such a venue. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002500=I have heard that you are already familiar with construction. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002600=I trust you to take care of the rest! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002700=Ah, but it is hard to find ways to occupy my time. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002800=I do hope things are progressing well with the ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002900=I find myself particularly looking forward to the insect wing. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003000=Fantastic! Magnificent! A true marvel! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003100=In case it was not apparent, these are my impressions upon seeing our new ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003200=I cannot adequately express my thanks! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003300=First you restore me to humanoid form, then you erect a ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop; in my honour. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003400=I am humbled. Truly. For your services, please take this. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003500=The ^c:d03e37;polishing machine^c:pop; can be used to clean up old fossils for the museum and expand your collection! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003600=Should you ever find any interesting collectables, do come and see me! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003700=You are also free to populate the displays with them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003800=I cannot wait to see you expand our insect collection! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003900=Oh my! Is that a new discovery? I must record it immediately!
