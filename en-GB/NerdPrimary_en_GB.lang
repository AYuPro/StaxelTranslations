staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000100=Hello there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000200=I've been in this village for quite some time now but I've yet to see many scientific advancements. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000300=I suspect this is largely due to the inadequate facilities available for research and development. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000400=After much careful consideration, I have decided to enlist your aid in rectifying the situation. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000500=You will help me, won't you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000600=Of course!
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000700=Maybe some other time.
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000800=Ah. I hadn't considered this outcome. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10000900=I'll have to think on it some more... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001000=Great! I wouldn't have expected any less from you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001100=So, first steps, first steps... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001200=Right! I suppose I'll need to get a permit for the establishment of a ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001300=Wouldn't want to be conducting dangerous experiments without permission to do so! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001400=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; would be absolutely furious! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001500=So how about you go see ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; and convince him to let us turn my home into a ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001600=You got the ^c:d03e37;permit^c:pop; then? Excellent! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001700=I've already begun documenting all the ^c:1486b0;machines^c:pop; I'm going to need for my experiments. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001800=These should tell you everything you need to know to get the place built! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10001900=I've thought hard about it, and I think you should expand ^c:1486b0;my home^c:pop; to accommodate them. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002000=So basically, get them made and install them in ^c:1486b0;my home^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002100=Any luck getting that ^c:d03e37;permit^c:pop; from ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002200=I don't really want to start construction without his permission... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002300=But I will if I have to! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002400=I trust the blueprints I supplied were detailed enough? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002500=I hope I'm not going to be in the way too much while you perform the renovations! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002600=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! It's a ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002700=Ahh...that satisfying thrum of electrical motion...how have I slept without it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002800=I'll be sure to let you know how my experiments proceed! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10002900=I hope that I'll be able to come up with some satisfactory results! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003000=Until then, good luck with the farm! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003100=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! It's a disaster! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003200=I was experimenting with my microwave when something terrible happened... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003300=I won't go into details on the experiment itself. Suffice to say it would have changed the world had it succeeded... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003400=But it didn't. It exploded instead. And now ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; is off cowering in a corner... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003500=I want to make him ^c:d03e37;a gift^c:pop; as an apology... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003600=Do you think I could trouble you to make some ^c:d03e37;machine parts^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003700=One ^c:d03e37;Machine Screen^c:pop;, two ^c:d03e37;Machine Cells^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;Machine Sapper^c:pop; should do it. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003800=That was quicker than I expected, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10003900=How do you manage to work so fast? Some of those parts can take me weeks to make myself! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004000=I'll get to work on fixing everything up. In the meantime, feel free to go about your daily business. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004100=There isn't much more you can do here right now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004200=I really want to apologise properly to ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004300=Could you make me one ^c:d03e37;Machine Screen^c:pop;, two ^c:d03e37;Machine Cells^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;Machine Sapper^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004400=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! It's a miracle! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004500=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; seems to have forgiven us already! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004600=I also managed to finish preparing ^c:1486b0;Leif's^c:pop; gift. Maybe you could deliver it for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004700=Quickly, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004800=I don't want to leave ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; cowering in his store too long... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10004900=It all went well I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005000=How much was he cowering? Not at all? Well... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005100=I hope that means he's forgiven us at least... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005200=I heard you went out of your way to insure the town so I can perform even bigger experiments! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005300=I hope you'll accept these as a payment of sorts... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005400=Look forward to my next experiment! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005500=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005600=I uh...may have another problem. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005700=Don't worry though! I didn't almost blow ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; up this time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005800=Oh, and in case you wondered, I also didn't successfully blow him up either. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10005900=This has absolutely nothing to do with ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; at all. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006000=Well...okay. So maybe it does. Just a little. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006100=But it's not really my fault. It's the ^c:1486b0;monster's^c:pop; fault... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006200=I only made it. I didn't tell it what to do! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006300=But as soon as it came to life, it ran right out of the ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop; and bumped into ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006400=I don't think I've ever seen anyone jump that high before in all my years. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006500=If only I'd had my tools on hand to evaluate at the height at the time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006600=But that is a different regret entirely. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006700=For now, I need you to deliver another ^c:d03e37;gift^c:pop; to ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006800=You gave him the ^c:d03e37;gift^c:pop;? Well at least that's one weight off my mind... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10006900=Now we just need to do something about ^c:1486b0;my creation^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007000=I'll give you my tracking device so you can track him down. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007100=Perhaps you'll have better luck convincing him to come back... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007200=Just so you know, he's engineered to have a fondness for ^c:d03e37;candy^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007300=Please run that ^c:d03e37;gift^c:pop; on over to ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007400=I was so used to having him hanging around all the time but I'm worried I've scared him off... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007500=You should be able to find ^c:1486b0;my creation^c:pop; on your map... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007600=It might be worth keeping in mind that he's engineered to have a fondness for ^c:d03e37;candy^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007700=You managed to bring back ^c:1486b0;my creation^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007800=Ah, thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! You're really a miracle! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10007900=But now...somehow we still need to clean up this mess... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008000=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; has been clamouring after us again...maybe you could start there? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008100=We can't keep it? I feared as much... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008200=Do you think perhaps we might be able to sell it to one of the ^c:1486b0;merchants^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008300=I could certainly use the funds for my research... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008400=Perhaps you could go and discuss it with them? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008500=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; has been demanding to see us... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008600=Do you think you could go on my behalf? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008700=No luck there, huh? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008800=^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; did send me a note while you were away though... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10008900=It seems like he's recovered a bit from the ordeal and it sounded like he might have an idea... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009000=Do you think you could go find out what it is? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009100=I can't really risk leaving ^c:1486b0;my creation^c:pop; to run off again... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009200=Were any of the ^c:1486b0;merchants^c:pop; willing to take him? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009300=Have you talked to them about it yet? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009400=Have you been to see ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; yet? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009500=It sounds like he might have an idea what to do... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009600=So what was ^c:1486b0;Leif's^c:pop; solution? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009700=His ^c:1486b0;sister^c:pop;, was it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009800=I would certainly like to meet her when she comes by to pick up ^c:1486b0;Frankie^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10009900=We may not quite be done with our experiments yet, but I think now is the time to give you the reward! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010000=Thank you for taking the time to help, none of the others would have put up with my experiments! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010100=Perhaps someday you'll agree to become a test subject! Or even a lab member! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010200=We could even move the lab into your home if you'd like! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010300=Just say the word! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010400=Hey ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! How are things? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010500=Did you hear that there's some big exec on the island right now? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010600=I...may have convinced a big game company to send someone out to pitch an idea... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010700=Do...do you think you could go and speak to them for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010800=Why don't you?
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10010900=He uh... Well, let's just say he's threatened to take out a restraining order... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011000=I might have been a little bit too persistent with my last pitch... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011100=He goes home at the end of the day! Please, just pitch him this... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011200=...and I'm sure he'll love it this time! When he does, get him to sign this for me! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011300=That should seal the deal nicely! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011400=He's back, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011500=You should hurry on over! I'd rather not have to try and convince them again... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011600=Ah. You couldn't find him in time? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011700=Well...not to worry. I think I can convince them to send him back in a few days... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011800=But perhaps not too many times! Let's not get this island blacklisted! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011900=Did you pitch my game yet, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012000=Hurry! There's not much time left! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012100=So that's what he said? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012200=I suppose it's a step up from my previous attempts! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012300=Thanks a lot, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012400=I know this isn't much, but I hope it'll at least express some of my gratitude! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012500=I'll let you know when I've put together a better plan of action! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012600=This is it ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I think I have it! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012700=I know what to do to impress that executive. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012800=Over the past few days I've invested mili- 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012900=-a lot of money into developing an ingenious new AR game! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013000=You know, augmented reality - bringing the game into the real world! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013100=And guess what, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, it's your lucky day; you get to try the alpha! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013200=Now what you need to do is take these ^c:d03e37;two devices^c:pop; and go catch some monsters! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013300=You'll find them in the world, hanging around on plants, or maybe even in the rivers! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013400=But remember - your normal ^c:d03e37;bug net^c:pop; isn't going to work on these - they're not really there! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013500=Same goes for the ^c:d03e37;fishing rod^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013600=Come back when you've caught 'em all! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013700=Hmm... It looks like you're still missing a few. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013800=I think there are still ^c:d03e37;{0-LQuest_FishCount^c:pop} in the ^c:1486b0;water^c:pop; and ^c:d03e37;{1-LQuest_BugCount^c:pop} on ^c:1486b0;land^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013900=I can't really get good stats on performance unless you catch every single one! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014000=Wow, that was faster than I expected! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014100=Have you done this before, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014200=Looks like it playtested pretty well - no major bugs to speak of! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014300=Well... Except for that one strange glitch I suppose... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014400=How did it feel to you? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014500=It was great!
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014600=Well... There are a few-
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014700=Fantastic! I'm happy to hear that! I'll get started on the pitch right away! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014800=Here, take these as a thank you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014900=Just a sample of the merch we're planning - have to get a head start before things take off, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015000=Now I just need to fly on over to show this stuff off to the people in charge! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015100=This is going to be an exciting time, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Really exciting!
