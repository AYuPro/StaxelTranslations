staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011400=Hey ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! How are things? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011500=Did you hear that there's some big exec on the island right now? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011600=I...may have convinced a big game company to send someone out to pitch an idea... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011700=Do...do you think you could go and speak to them for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011800=Why don't you?
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10011900=He uh... Well, let's just say he's threatened to take out a restraining order... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012000=I might have been a little bit too persistent with my last pitch... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012100=He goes home at the end of the day! Please, just pitch him this... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012200=...and I'm sure he'll love it this time! When he does, get him to sign this for me! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012300=That should seal the deal nicely! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012400=He's back, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012500=You should hurry on over! I'd rather not have to try and convince them again... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012600=Ah. You couldn't find him in time? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012700=Well...not to worry. I think I can convince them to send him back in a few days... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012800=But perhaps not too many times! Let's not get this island blacklisted! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10012900=Did you pitch my game yet, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013000=Hurry! There's not much time left! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013100=So that's what he said? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013200=I suppose it's a step up from my previous attempts! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013300=Thanks a lot, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013400=I know this isn't much, but I hope it'll at least express some of my gratitude! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013500=I'll let you know when I've put together a better plan of action! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013600=This is it ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I think I have it! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013700=I know what to do to impress that executive. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013800=Over the past few days I've invested mili- 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10013900=-a lot of money into developing an ingenious new AR game! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014000=You know, augmented reality - bringing the game into the real world! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014100=And guess what, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, it's your lucky day; you get to try the alpha! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014200=Now what you need to do is take these ^c:d03e37;two devices^c:pop; and go catch some monsters! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014300=You'll find them in the world, hanging around on plants, or maybe even in the rivers! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014400=But remember - your normal ^c:d03e37;bug net^c:pop; isn't going to work on these - they're not really there! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014500=Same goes for the ^c:d03e37;fishing rod^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014600=Come back when you've caught 'em all! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014700=Hmm... It looks like you're still missing a few. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014800=I think there are still ^c:d03e37;{0-LQuest_FishCount^c:pop} in the ^c:1486b0;water^c:pop; and ^c:d03e37;{1-LQuest_BugCount^c:pop} on ^c:1486b0;land^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10014900=I can't really get good stats on performance unless you catch every single one! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015000=Wow, that was faster than I expected! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015100=Have you done this before, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015200=Looks like it playtested pretty well - no major bugs to speak of! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015300=Well... Except for that one strange glitch I suppose... 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015400=How did it feel to you? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015500=It was great!
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015600=Well... There are a few-
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015700=Fantastic! I'm happy to hear that! I'll get started on the pitch right away! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015800=Here, take these as a thank you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10015900=Just a sample of the merch we're planning - have to get a head start before things take off, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10016000=Now I just need to fly on over to show this stuff off to the people in charge! 
staxel.village.dialogue.NerdPrimary.line:10016100=This is going to be an exciting time, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Really exciting!
