staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10000500=Ice cream, mya? I'd much rather have fish! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10000600=But fishing alone is a little bit intimidating right now mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10000700=Especially out in the forests... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10000800=Apparently there's some strange creature moaning and growling... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10000900=It gives me the chills mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001000=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001200=The other day I was out fishing in the ^c:1486b0;ocean^c:pop;, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001300=I hooked something really tough! It must've been massive, mya! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001400=But then something terrible happened... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001500=My line snapped and I went tumbling over and over and over... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001600=By the time I stopped, whatever it was had escaped, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001700=It took my ^c:d03e37;lucky hook^c:pop; with it! It must be still stuck in the creature somewhere. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001800=I'm too scared to go back for it, mya... Do you think you could...go for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10001900=It's pretty important, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002000=Any luck finding my ^c:d03e37;lucky hook^c:pop;, mya? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002100=I lost it somewhere out in the ^c:1486b0;ocean^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002800=Oh... Is that so, mya? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002900=Let me know if you find my ^c:d03e37;lucky hook^c:pop;, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003000=I... I don't want to tell you what's in the message, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003100=Not yet... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003200=But if you can take this to ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; for me, he'll know what to give you. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003300=And thank you again, mya. You don't know what this ^c:d03e37;hook^c:pop; means... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002200=Oh...! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002300=Is that my ^c:d03e37;lucky hook^c:pop; stuck in that ^c:d03e37;bottle^c:pop;, mya? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002400=It definitely looks like it, mya! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002500=Can I have that ^c:d03e37;hooked bottle^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002600=Of course! But what does it say?
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10002700=I don't think this is the one.
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005700=Oh, you have them all, mya! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005750=It sounds like they're doing well, mya! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005800=But still... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005900=There's still one more missing, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006000=I guess it's not coming... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006100=Oh, but you did a great job, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006200=I'll give you a little something in return, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006300=Maybe if we keep fishing it'll turn up someday, mya? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006400=I didn't actually start fishing because I like fish, you know, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006500=But... I suppose it wasn't really for the letters either, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10006600=If... If it's alright, I'll let you know if I need help again in the future, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004200=Mmm? You actually want to know, mya? Really? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004300=No one ever wants to know, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004400=It's a bit embarassing, but I'm not very good at fishing, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004500=My brothers and sisters send me ^c:d03e37;messages in bottles^c:pop; every now and again... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004600=But I haven't been able to fish any of them up lately, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004700=Do you think you could help, mya? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004800=They tend to end up in ^c:1486b0;very strange places^c:pop;, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004900=There's definitely one in ^c:1486b0;the ocean^c:pop; and one in ^c:1486b0;the lake^c:pop;, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005000=I think I also saw one in ^c:1486b0;the blueish part of the mines^c:pop;, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005100=Please bring them to me as soon as you can find them, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005200=I'll keep looking too... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003400=Mmm... ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. Hi, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003500=Do you have siblings, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? Do you see them often? 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003600=I haven't seen mine in years, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003700=They don't even send messages as often anymore... Or...well...I'm not very good at finding them, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003800=Maybe... Do you think... No, mya. That would be asking too much, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10003900=What's wrong?
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004000=See you around!
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10004100=Okay, mya... See you around...mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005300=It looks like you're still missing some of the letters, mya... 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005400=There should be at least three, and they should all be different, mya. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005500=One was in ^c:1486b0;the ocean^c:pop; and another was in ^c:1486b0;the lake^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.CaithgirlPrimary.line:10005600=I think I saw one in ^c:1486b0;the blueish part of the mines^c:pop; too, mya...
